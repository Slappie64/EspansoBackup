# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

# Title: Date Insertion
# Description: Type ;date to quickly insert the current date.
  - trigger: ";date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: "mydate"
        type: "date"
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

# Title: Time Insertion
# Description: Type ;time to quickly insert the current time.
  - trigger: ";time"
    replace: "{{mytime}}"
    vars:
      - name: "mytime"
        type: "date"
        params:
          format: "%H:%M:%S"


  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
